# This is a Python script that uses the Streamlit library to create an interactive web application. 
# The purpose of this web application is to simulate a conversation between an entrepreneur and an investor. 
# The conversation is facilitated by GPT-3.5-turbo, a powerful language model from OpenAI. Here is a breakdown of the code:
# Note: This script requires an OpenAI API key to function correctly and the user needs to supply it through the Streamlit interface. This key provides access to the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API used for generating responses.








# Importing libraries: Importing necessary libraries for the application including Streamlit (st), pandas (pd), and OpenAI.

# Main script: In the main part of the script, it sets the page title, icon, and layout for the Streamlit web application, sets a header, calls the sidebar() function, and provides a text area for the user to write their startup idea. It then handles the interaction when a user clicks the "Submit" button. It first checks if the API key is configured and if an idea has been entered. If both conditions are met, it initiates a conversation with the OpenAI model.
